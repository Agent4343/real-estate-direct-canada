# Frontend/UI Status

## ❌ No Frontend UI Currently Built

**Current Status:** Backend API Only

The project currently consists of:
- ✅ **Backend API Server** (Node.js/Express)
- ✅ **70+ API Endpoints**
- ✅ **MongoDB Database**
- ✅ **Swagger API Documentation UI** (at `/api-docs`)
- ❌ **No User-Facing Frontend/UI**

## 🌐 What's Available Now

### Swagger API Documentation UI
**URL:** http://localhost:3000/api-docs

This is an interactive API testing interface where you can:
- Browse all API endpoints
- Test API calls directly
- See request/response schemas
- View authentication requirements

**This is NOT a user-facing UI** - it's for developers to test the API.

## 💡 Quick Solution: Swagger UI

For now, you can use the **Swagger UI** to interact with the API:

1. Visit: http://localhost:3000/api-docs
2. Test all endpoints
3. Register users
4. Create properties
5. Make transactions

**This is fully functional for testing and development!**
