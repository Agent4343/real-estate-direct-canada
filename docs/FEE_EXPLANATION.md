# Success Fee Explanation: 1.5% with Min $999 / Max $9,999

## How the Success Fee Works

The success fee is calculated as **1.5% of the sale price**, but with two important rules:

### Rule 1: Minimum Floor ($999)
If 1.5% of the sale price is LESS than $999, you still charge $999 (the minimum).

### Rule 2: Maximum Cap ($9,999)
If 1.5% of the sale price is MORE than $9,999, you only charge $9,999 (the maximum cap).

## Detailed Examples

### Example 1: Small Property ($250,000)

**Calculation:**
- Sale Price: $250,000
- 1.5% of $250,000 = $3,750

**Result:** Fee = **$3,750**
- This is MORE than the minimum ($999), so minimum doesn't apply
- This is LESS than the maximum ($9,999), so cap doesn't apply

---

### Example 2: Very Small Property ($50,000)

**Calculation:**
- Sale Price: $50,000
- 1.5% of $50,000 = $750

**Result:** Fee = **$999** (minimum applies)
- 1.5% would be $750, but that's LESS than the minimum ($999)
- So you charge the minimum of $999 instead

**Why have a minimum?**
- Covers your platform costs even for low-value properties
- Ensures fair compensation for the work involved
- Prevents loss on very small transactions

---

### Example 3: Medium Property ($500,000)

**Calculation:**
- Sale Price: $500,000
- 1.5% of $500,000 = $7,500

**Result:** Fee = **$7,500**
- This is MORE than the minimum ($999), so minimum doesn't apply
- This is LESS than the maximum ($9,999), so cap doesn't apply

---

### Example 4: Large Property ($750,000)

**Calculation:**
- Sale Price: $750,000
- 1.5% of $750,000 = $11,250

**Result:** Fee = **$9,999** (maximum cap applies)
- 1.5% would be $11,250, but that's MORE than the maximum ($9,999)
- So you cap it at $9,999

**Why have a maximum cap?**
- Keeps fees reasonable for high-value properties
- More attractive to sellers of expensive homes
- Still profitable even with the cap

---

### Example 5: Very Large Property ($2,000,000)

**Calculation:**
- Sale Price: $2,000,000
- 1.5% of $2,000,000 = $30,000

**Result:** Fee = **$9,999** (maximum cap applies)
- 1.5% would be $30,000, but that exceeds the cap
- So you charge the maximum of $9,999

## Visual Breakdown

```
Property Value    →  1.5% Calculation  →  Minimum Check  →  Maximum Check  →  Final Fee

$50,000          →  $750              →  $999 (applies) →  N/A            →  $999
$100,000         →  $1,500            →  ✓ Over $999    →  ✓ Under $9,999 →  $1,500
$250,000         →  $3,750            →  ✓ Over $999    →  ✓ Under $9,999 →  $3,750
$500,000         →  $7,500            →  ✓ Over $999    →  ✓ Under $9,999 →  $7,500
$750,000         →  $11,250           →  ✓ Over $999    →  $9,999 (applies) →  $9,999
$1,000,000       →  $15,000           →  ✓ Over $999    →  $9,999 (applies) →  $9,999
$2,000,000       →  $30,000           →  ✓ Over $999    →  $9,999 (applies) →  $9,999
```

## When is the Fee Paid?

### "At Closing" Means:
- The fee is charged **ONLY when the sale is completed**
- It's paid when:
  - Transaction status changes to "Completed"
  - Property ownership is transferred
  - All conditions are met
  - The sale is finalized

### Payment Breakdown:

1. **Listing Fee ($299)** - Paid upfront when property is listed
2. **Success Fee (1.5%)** - Paid at closing/completion

### Important:
- If the property **doesn't sell** = No success fee charged (only listing fee paid)
- If the property **sells** = Both listing fee + success fee are charged

## Why This Structure?

### Benefits for You:
✅ **Fair pricing** - Scales with property value
✅ **Protected floor** - Minimum ensures you don't lose money on small sales
✅ **Attractive cap** - Maximum keeps high-value properties competitive

### Benefits for Sellers:
✅ **Transparent** - They know exactly what they'll pay
✅ **Fair** - Percentage scales with their property value
✅ **Capped** - High-value properties don't pay excessive fees
✅ **Protected** - Low-value properties get a reasonable minimum

## Real-World Comparison

Let's compare what a seller pays:

### Traditional Realtor (5% commission):
- $250,000 property = **$12,500**
- $500,000 property = **$25,000**
- $1,000,000 property = **$50,000**

### Your Platform (1.5% + $299 listing fee):
- $250,000 property = $999 + $299 = **$1,298** (90% savings!)
- $500,000 property = $7,500 + $299 = **$7,799** (69% savings!)
- $1,000,000 property = $9,999 + $299 = **$10,298** (79% savings!)

## Summary

**1.5% of sale price** = Base calculation
- Multiply sale price by 0.015 (or divide by 100 and multiply by 1.5)

**Minimum $999** = Safety floor
- If 1.5% is less than $999, charge $999 instead

**Maximum $9,999** = Cap for high-value properties
- If 1.5% is more than $9,999, charge $9,999 instead

**At closing** = Payment timing
- Fee is charged when the sale is completed, not when listed

This structure ensures:
- ✅ Fair compensation for you
- ✅ Competitive pricing for sellers
- ✅ Protection for both small and large transactions
